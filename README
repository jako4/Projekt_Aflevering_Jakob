This Script will create a backup of a directory, then zip and compress the file.

You can either create these two paths on your computer. 'data' is for your files storage,
and backup is where your backed-up data will be stored.
C:\files\data
C:\files\backup

Or you can change the "source" and "destination" variables to fit your own setup.

Note: Run the file called Backup_Final.py not the Backup_test.py.
Backup_test.py contains references and is not the complete script.
